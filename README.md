Multimple Linear Regression Analysis on Boston Housing Dataset using Incremental Mathematical Stream Regression Anlysis and Approximate Stream Regression Approach.

Both methods use a window based approach to prevent multiple scans of the entire data set, nevertheless they are able to maintain the accuracy of the regression model.

IMSR recalculates the regression function parameters based on the latest data in the current window and the synopsis of previous data.

ASR approximately estimates the regression parameters by using aweighted average of the parameters obtained from current window data and the regression parameters of pervious windows.
